# Grokking Algorithms

This is a repository where I'll practice and implement all the algorithms I learned while reading the book "Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Y. Bjargava (and more).

For each of these algorithms I'll provide:
- explanation
- use case
- the algorithm itself (written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and/or [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)))

I know that there's an [official repository](https://github.com/egonSchiele/grokking_algorithms) where they provide all the algorithm done upfront, this is for study purpose only
